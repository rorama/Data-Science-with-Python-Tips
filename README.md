# Motivation for this project
In the spirit of sharing, this project is an accumulation of some of the daily recording of work done as part of several projects. As you know, everyday provides an opportunity to learn, no matter your level of expertise. Therefore, I share some very basic as well as some rather advanced tips.

Currently, I share some basic Python language fundamentals and Pandas, but will be expanding with time. I hope to include tips on Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other related libraries that I used in some recent develpoments.

There are many web development frameworks all over. In the case of Python, we can talk of Flask, Django, etc. With the growing need for development projects, many find themselves in a situation where they use a framwork without first understandig the basic principles of programming and the specific language fundamentals. Data Structures is one tha suffers heavily in such a circumstance.

This project only aims to help those who might find themselves in such circumstances. It just touches on the very basics, nothing more. It is simply a wake up call that programming/development requires much more than creating a data entry form, connecting to a database and allowing users to enter data. With all available online resources, we all should endavor to learn the fundamentals before diving into any framework.

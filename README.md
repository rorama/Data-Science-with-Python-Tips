Python Data Structures

# Motivation for this project: 
There are many web development frameworks all over. In the case of Python, we can talk of Flask, Django, etc. With the growing need for development projects, many find themselves in a situation where they use a framwork without forst understandig the basic principles of programming and the specific language fundamentals. Data Structures is one tha suffers heavily in such a circumstance.

# Data structures in Python: used for storing and manipulating data in a program
"Data structures" is one of the foundations for any programming language. It would be pointless to dive into programming using a language without understanding the basics - including data tructures.

- Primitive data structures: Integer, Float, String
- Container data structures: List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set

- Integer, Float, String, Tuple are immutable - cannot change once assigned
- List, Dictionary, Set are mutable - can change after assignment

String, List and Tuples are also called sequences.

A thorough understanding of data structures before undertaking a programming project pays off. In practice, you will realize that you are dealing with data structures each and every time you code.
